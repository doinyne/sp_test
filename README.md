***Smart Pension*** 

Hello, here is my solution to the Smart Ruby Developer Test. I have tried my best at completing the following tasks;
 ```
 1. Recieve a log as an argument.
 ```
 ```
 2. list of webpages with most page views ordered from most page views to least page views.
 ```
 I used RSpec to test my code and installed simplecov gem so I could see the test coverage.

 ## Set up

 * Clone repo 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/doinyne/sp_test.git
 ```
 * run in CLI
 ```
 bundle install
 ```

Set up ruby files, rspec and simplecov

get ruby to read the webserver.log file

at the moment I can read the webserver log as a method.

next... look into manipulating the data and creating arguements. 

create hash for log

interate through hash so only use webpages

count how many times webpages appear in hash
